# Multi-level Upgrading Made Easy

If you're like me you think the Evospace tech tree is pretty awesome. It's super fun to climb the ladder from weak and puny to super scientist!

But, upgrading research is a bastard after awhile. Presently I can make the Hard Metal Fermenter but really need the Neutronium version. I'm sure I can hit the Researches key (default J) to bring up the tree, then scan around until I find the right button. Ugh.

There's a much easier way! Use that searcher in the crafting panel:

The various metals are displayed. If you click a level you can craft it will start being built -- and for the levels higher than you can build it will pop the research screen!

tl;dr: Search from the crafter, click the yellow flavor, research, prosper
