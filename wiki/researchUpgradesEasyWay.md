If you're like me you think the Evospace tech tree is pretty awesome.

But, upgrading research is a bastard after awhile. Here we can see I can make the Hard Metal version of the Assembler but not the Neutronium. Going back to the Researches view and finding the right tech in the tree isn't much fun.

Fortunately there is an easier way. Open your inventory crafting panel and middle-mouse on the version we can build. The Recipes page is displayed for the thing.

On the left we see a list of all the stuff the thing can create, and at the top left the various flavors. Middle-mouse the next level up, here it's Neutronium.

Now, on the right side of the screen is the production requirement to create a new thing at that level. Left-click that thing.

*select neutornium-level assembler*

Voila, the Research screen opens and the tech is displayed. Just click Select to research it and Bob's your uncle.
