## Crafting

Crafting is the core of the gameplay in Evospace.

Crafting can be done manually - this is generally best for [machines](machines.md) that will be used and placed in small numbers - or automatically - good for frequently-used items like [conveyors](conveyor.md), [pipes](pipe.md), and [cables](cable.md).

Some crafting can only be done by [crafting machines](crafting-machines.md).
